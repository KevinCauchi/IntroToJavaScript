//You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
//The value 10 would be displayed in the console. Note that the space character between "Alan" and "Peter" is also counted.

// Setup
let lastNameLength = 0;
const lastName = "Lovelace";

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
